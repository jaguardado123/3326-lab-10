# Lab Assignment 10

In this lab you will practice working with for loops.

Same as the previous labs, you need to set up your workspace (class and main() method).

## Let's get started!

First, let's look at the name of our .java file in the `src/` directory and name your class accordingly and remember to make it `public`. Next, **create your main() method inside your class**.

Now let's begin!

### For Loops

Loops in Java are exactly the same as in C++.

For loos are used when you know exactly how many times you want your code block to execute.

Same as the while loops, for loops can utilize `break` and `continue` statements.
